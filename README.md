# Processing-Haystack
# Assignment Details:

##Standard Assignment (all must complete)

Implement the sort function in O(n2). Then implement binary search in place of the linear search implementation in the search function.

Hint: I highly recommend decreasing the size of your haystack to 10 while developing the algorithms and then increasing the size of the haystack to no greater than 10,000 while testing (unless you want to leave your computer running for days at a time). Also, keep in mind that you can println an array to view its contents.

##Hacker Assignment (optional, provides no additional credit)

Implement the sort function in better than O(n2). Then implement binary search as a recursive algorithm in place of the linear search implementation in the search function. The hacker assignments with the fastest times will be given bragging rights.
